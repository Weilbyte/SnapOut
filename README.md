Snap Out adds the ability to calm down your pawns!

Instead of you having to jail them, down them or let them run loose until they lose a limb to a tiger, you now have a somewhat of a chance to calm them down.

Only capable (hearing, moving and talking) pawns with the 'Warden' work type ticked can calm others down!

* Ability to calm pawns down
  * Success chance depends on the skill of the pawn and opinion - multipliers can be changed in options
  * Option for opinion only if you don't like it to take the social skill into account
  * As in addition to colonists, both prisoners and traders can be calmed as well
* Works on aggressive pawns
  * They may attack if the attempt fails!
* Pawns saying stuff on attempts - *fo your immurshun*
  * Suggest me some extra sentences I could put in if you want to
* Settings menu to change most aspects of the mod

Should play nice with ongoing games and mods that add mental breaks (i.e. Psychology)

Upon calming violent prisoners, they might be stuck in a sad wandering state. You could let them be or just beat them to a pulp.

Open an issue if you happen to stumble over any. Or, if you feel generous, you can fix the issue yourself and contribute with a pull request.
